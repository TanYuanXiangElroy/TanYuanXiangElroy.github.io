# Hey there!

I'm Elroy, a 21-year-old guy on a journey of self-discovery through the exciting worlds of IT and engineering. Currently calling Singapore home, I'm taking a detour from the typical academic path to explore and develop myself before diving into SUTD for a diploma.

## 👨‍💻 Tech Enthusiast and Aspiring Engineer
From tinkering with gadgets to coding late into the night, my passion for technology has been the driving force behind my journey. But it's not just about bytes and circuits – it's about constant growth and self-discovery.

## 🔄 Constantly Evolving
Join me as I embark on a mission of personal redevelopment. I'm all about trying new things and pushing my boundaries. Whether it's learning a new programming language, experimenting with design, or diving into the world of robotics, I'm on a quest to reinvent myself, one project at a time.

## 📚 Prepping for SUTD
Currently on a leave of absence, I'm gearing up for the academic challenges at SUTD. Excited to dive into the world of engineering, I'll be documenting not just the coursework but the personal growth that comes with embracing new challenges. It's a unique chapter of preparation and self-discovery before the classroom adventures begin.

## 💼 Building My Professional Profile
While this blog is my personal space, you can check out my professional side on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanyuanxiangelroy/). However u can find, you'll find a detailed CV showcasing my skills, projects, and the ongoing saga of personal and professional growth in this website. Let's connect and share insights on the ever-evolving landscapes of IT and engineering!

Thanks for joining me on this rollercoaster ride – from coding marathons to engineering blueprints, it's all part of the adventure. Stick around for the laughs, the challenges, and the triumphs that come with trying something new every day. 🚀
