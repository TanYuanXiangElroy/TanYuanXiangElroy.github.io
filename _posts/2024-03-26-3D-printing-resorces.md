This is a curated list of resources I commonly use, this is a pool of resources that hopefully can jump start your learning and show you new things.

The resources may not be most up to date but they are what work for me. Since I started to 3D print and own a 3D printer since 2020 I will update this when I find something that I use often


## Website for STL

Most don't want to design their own models or don't have the skill or time but due to the internet people can share their own models and you can benefit by downloading and using their files



> ##### WARNING
>
> a good rule of thumb is not to download g-code on the websites. 
>As there may be malicious actors that will program the code that will damage your printer. Always download the file and let the owner of the printer slice the model into g-code as they should know their printer the best

{: .block-tip }

1. https://www.thingiverse.com/

The OG STL website that most people in the 3D printing space know about. However I don't use it anymore as I dislike the UI and there is better websites out there

2. https://www.printables.com/

This is my primary STL website for 3D printing. The content is better than thingiverse as there are periodic competitions in selected themes and there is honestly more stuff here. 

There is a reward mechanism with I seen people use to get free high quality filament from Prusa

3. https://makerworld.com/en

The newest of the batch that I am using and honestly looking very promising they are inviting people to create models specially for their website 

Got now March 2024 there are people who redeem a bambu 3D printer with this website


This are good mentions I don't use them often as they are paid websites

4. https://cults3d.com/en

It has really high quality models that are unique to the website. But it is because they are paid models. If you are opening a store and need some models to print I recommend looking at this website to legally get models that you can print and sell

5. https://www.myminifactory.com/

They have unique models for miniatures but they are mostly paid but some times you can get some for free. If you play D&D or any thing that requires miniatures this is a good place to go


Now we go to websites that I use but are more general model websites not specifically for 3d printing this means most of the models are not design with 3D printing in mind and would need a lot of supports when printing them

6. https://grabcad.com/library

It is more of a mechanical model website. I use it to get accurate models of mechanical parts that I use like nuts and bolts.


6. https://thangs.com/

It's more like a library of models. I like it because it is free to use and there are nice models of TV and movies like Pokémon.


## CAD software
Now you want to take it up a notch and start customizing your own models to print. CAD computer aided design software allows you to design models in 3D.

### ThinkerCAD
If you have done any basic 3D printing workshop they will recommend this as it is very basic, simple and web based.  You drag and drop blocks to create the shape you want easy to learn and teach. But for more complicated designs and objects it is tedious to make in ThinkerCAD. 

### Onshape
A proper CADing software I recommend for hobbyists as there is a free version with it being web based meaning you just need an internet connection to get started. You will also learn the proper interface which will be transferable between paid CADing software. 

### Fusion360
The software I primarily use. The only reason why I used it is because it is free for students and my school needs it. But it has done good features like team sharing cad works but I don't recommend it for hobbyist as you will need to spend money to my a license to use it 

### AutoCAD
Same with AutoCAD I used it as one of my school models needed their simulator features.

No matter which CAD software you choose try not to skip around too much as each has it own separate shortcut and controls that you need time to get used to

## Slicers software 

Now you need to convert your models into G-Code readable files for your printer to print.

### CuraSlicer
The one I used the longest it's basic but with plug in you can get it to do a lot of things. 

### PrusaSlicer
It's great if you have a pusa machine and its accompanying filament. It's a good slicer that I used for a while since the school club used this.

### Banbu Studio
The latest slicer I used and the one I am currently using the reason is that I can share the account I make for it with trusted people and my preset and configurations will sink up.


No matter what slicer you use you should just configure its setting to your printer and stick with it. My advice as when I was printing in school I had someone use 2 different slicers in 6 months. He needed to configure the setting to his printer and he spent a lot of time on it.

## other resources that I rely on

### Blog
https://all3dp.com/

A blog I use when I just want something to print they have top 10 __ models and more. Plus they explain the basics of 3d printing quite well.

### Youtube creators
MakersMuse, 
CNCKitchen, 
thenextlayer, 
3DPrintingNerd, 
TeachingTech

This are some channels I watch and somewhat trust in content. They all have quite a few 3D printing videos so you should go and watch them for their comparison videos and latest tech in 3D printing space videos.

By following this people you can get the latest updates on software updates new 3D printers and more.

### Reddit groups

> Remember to always read the pin comment before posting 
{: .block-tip }

r/3Dprinting

The general Reddit group for 3d printing 

r/FixMyPrint

How can you fix a problem when you don't know what it's called? This group will help you with that. Also see other mistakes that other people made and suggestions on how to fix them

r/functionalprint

Prints that work don’t need to be complicated often they are simple in design I get inspired by other creations that I can apply to my daily life

r/(your printer name)

Most 3D printers if it is large enough will have a reddit group dedicated to it where you can go into details on upgrade paths if you are the hands on type. If your printer is not very popular you can try its brand name instead and normally you should be able to find it.



I will add stuff to this webpage when I find more interesting stuff. Found something that I miss or think I should add or remove.
